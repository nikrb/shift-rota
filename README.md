React implementation of a shift work rota.

download repo and npm install.

To start:

1. get mongo running
2. init db with scripts/init.mongo.js
2. run the server (nodemon to update on change)
   * unixy: npm start-api
   * dos  : npm run dos-start
3. run webpack to watch for front end changes
   webpack --watch

Been developing on local win7 machine so unixy version may need some attention to get it to work.
